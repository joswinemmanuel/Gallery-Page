            <h1>Computer Lover Project</h1>
            <p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations
                (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations
                known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. The term computer
                system may refer to a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system,
                software, and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation; or to a group of computers that
                are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.</p>
            <p>A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple
                special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices
                like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices such as personal
                computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of
                computers and users.</p>
            <p>Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus
                have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some
                mechanical devices were built to automate long, tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More
                sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The
                first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II, both electromechanical
                and using thermionic valves. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the
                silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit chip technologies in the late
                1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and
                versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts
                increasing at a rapid pace (Moore's law noted that counts doubled every two years), leading to the
                Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.</p>
